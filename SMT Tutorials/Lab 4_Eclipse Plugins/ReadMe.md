<h1>Lab-4: Eclipse Extensions and Extension Points</h1>

This lab is about Eclipse plug-in development. Specifically, we worked on the tasks of creating Eclipse plug-in projects, creating 
extension points and extensions, and running and installing the developed plug-ins. We created two plug-ins with one extending 
the extension point declared by the other. We also ran these two plug-ins and installed them in Eclipse.
